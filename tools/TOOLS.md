# DelegateMQ Tools

Diagnostic tools and Terminal User Interface (TUI) dashboards for the DelegateMQ `dmq::databus::DataBus`. Two complementary consoles plus the bridge components needed to integrate them into your application.

## Tools Overview

| Tool | Executable | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Spy Console** | `dmq-spy` | Real-time live feed of all DataBus messages — acts as a "Software Logic Analyzer" |
| **Node Monitor** | `dmq-monitor` | Live network topology view — shows all active nodes, their status, uptime, and published topics |
| **Thread Monitor**| `dmq-thread` | Real-time per-thread metrics — shows queue depths and dispatch latency across the system |

## dmq-thread — Thread Monitor Console

**DelegateMQ Thread Monitor** is a performance diagnostics dashboard. It provides real-time visibility into the health of every instrumented thread in a distributed system, displaying queue depths and dispatch latency (avg/max).

### Key Features

*   **Per-Thread Metrics**: Tracks current, window-max, and all-time max queue depths.
*   **Latency Analysis**: Measures how long messages wait in the queue before being dispatched (Average and Max).
*   **CPU Grouping**: Threads are grouped by their logical CPU name (e.g. GUI, Controller, Safety).
*   **Real-Time 1Hz Updates**: Per-node telemetry is pushed to the dashboard every second.
*   **Multi-Node Aggregation**: Automatically aggregates and sorts threads from multiple physical machines or processes.
*   **Zero-Impact Design**: Statistics are captured atomically and transmitted via a dedicated background bridge to ensure no interference with application timing.

### How it Works

1.  **Instrumentation**: The `dmq::os::Thread` class tracks queue stats and message timestamps during normal operation.
2.  **Telemetry Service** (`ThreadMonitor`): A service within the application that polls registered threads and publishes `ThreadStatsPacket` to the local DataBus.
3.  **The Node Bridge** (`bridge/NodeBridge.cpp/.h`): Reuses the existing node bridge to automatically pick up `ThreadStatsPacket` topics and broadcast them over UDP.
4.  **The Thread Monitor Console** (`thread/thread_main.cpp`): The standalone `dmq-thread` application that receives and visualizes the aggregated telemetry.

### Integrating Thread Monitoring into Your App

#### 1. Register Threads
In your application initialization, register the threads you want to monitor:

```cpp
#include "extras/util/ThreadMonitor.h"

// ... create your threads ...
dmq::util::ThreadMonitor::Register(&mySystemThread);
dmq::util::ThreadMonitor::Register(&myNetworkThread);
```

#### 2. Start the Monitor
Enable the 1Hz telemetry polling:

```cpp
dmq::util::ThreadMonitor::Enable();
```

#### 3. Start NodeBridge
Ensure `NodeBridge` is started (see Node Monitor section above). It will automatically discover and broadcast the thread statistics.

### Usage

```bash
./dmq-thread [port] [options]

# Basic unicast (default port 9998)
./dmq-thread

# Join a multicast group (auto-detects local interface)
./dmq-thread 9998 --multicast 239.1.1.1
```

## dmq-spy — DataBus Spy Console

**DelegateMQ Spy** is a modern, standalone diagnostic TUI for the DelegateMQ `dmq::databus::DataBus`. It captures, filters, and displays every message published to the bus in real-time across threads and network boundaries. 

<img src="dmq-spy-screenshot.png" alt="DelegateMQ Spy Screenshot" style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%;">       

### Logic Analyzer Mode

`dmq-spy` features a "Logic Analyzer" engine for high-fidelity timing diagnostics:

*   **Chrono-Sorting**: Automatically inserts late-arriving UDP packets into their correct historical position based on source timestamps. This eliminates confusion from network packet reordering.
*   **Session Time**: Displays time in seconds relative to the start of the trace (`0.000000`).
*   **Dual Delta Tracking**: 
    *   **T-Delta (Topic Delta)**: Time since the previous message of the *same* topic from the *same* sender. Use for signal jitter and frequency analysis.
    *   **B-Delta (Bus Delta)**: Time since *any* previous message from the same sender. Use for traffic density and burst analysis.

### Key Features

*   **Real-Time Live Feed**: Instant visualization of every message published to the `dmq::databus::DataBus` (Newest at Top).
*   **Regex-Based Filtering**: Dynamically filter topics using regular expressions to isolate specific system events.
*   **Intelligent Color-Coding**: Values are highlighted based on content (Green for OK/Running, Red for Error/Fault, Yellow for Warn).
*   **Unicast & Multicast Support**: Monitor point-to-point traffic or join a multicast group for one-to-many monitoring.
*   **Log to Disk**: High-performance background logging to a file for later historical analysis.
*   **High-Resolution Timestamps**: Every packet is timestamped at the source with microsecond precision using monotonic clocks.
*   **Pause & Resume**: Press `Ctrl-P` to freeze the display for inspection. Data continues to be gathered in the background circular buffer (2,000 entries).
*   **Zero-Impact Architecture**: The Spy Bridge uses an asynchronous internal queue and a dedicated background thread to ensure monitoring never blocks or slows down your main application.

### How it Works

1.  **The Spy Console** (`spy/main.cpp`): The standalone `dmq-spy` application that displays the data in an aligned table layout.
2.  **The Spy Bridge** (`bridge/SpyBridge.cpp/.h`): A small component you add to your own application to export its internal bus traffic over UDP.

### Integrating SpyBridge into Your App

#### 1. Include the Bridge
Add `tools/bridge/SpyBridge.cpp` and `tools/bridge/SpyBridge.h` to your build system and enable `DMQ_DATABUS_TOOLS`.

#### 2. Register Stringifiers
For every topic you want to see in the console, register a stringifier function:

```cpp
dmq::databus::DataBus::RegisterStringifier<MyData>("sensor/temp", [](const MyData& d) {
    return std::to_string(d.value) + " C";
});
```

#### 3. Start the Bridge
Call `Start` (unicast) or `StartMulticast` at application initialization:

```cpp
#include "SpyBridge.h"

int main() {
    // Unicast to a specific console IP
    SpyBridge::Start("127.0.0.1", 9999);

    // OR: ...
    SpyBridge::Stop();
}
```

### Usage

```bash
./dmq-spy [port] [options]

# Basic unicast (default port 9999)
./dmq-spy

# Log all traffic to a file
./dmq-spy 9999 --log traffic.log
```

**Controls:**
- `Ctrl-P` — Pause / Resume live feed
- `c` — Clear trace and reset session time
- `q` — Quit

## dmq-monitor — Node Monitor Console

**DelegateMQ Node Monitor** is a live network topology dashboard. Instead of showing individual messages, it shows *which nodes* are active on the DataBus network — their hostnames, IP addresses, uptime, total message counts, and the topics they publish. Nodes are color-coded by health status (Online / Stale / Offline).

<img src="dmq-monitor-screenshot.png" alt="DelegateMQ Node Monitor Screenshot" style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%;">

### Key Features

*   **Live Node Table**: Displays all discovered nodes with status, IP address, hostname, message count, uptime, and time since last heartbeat.
*   **Health Status**: Nodes are color-coded — green (Online), yellow (Stale), red (Offline) — based on heartbeat recency.
*   **Multi-Machine Support**: Two nodes with the same name on different machines are shown as separate rows, identified by IP address.
*   **Topic Discovery**: Automatically discovers which DataBus topics each node publishes, displayed in a detail panel for the selected node.
*   **Unicast & Multicast Support**: Receive heartbeats point-to-point or via a shared multicast group.
*   **Interactive Navigation**: Arrow keys to select a node, `c` to clear offline entries, `q` to quit.
*   **Zero-Impact Architecture**: The Node Bridge uses a dedicated background thread with a 1-second heartbeat interval that does not block your application.

### How it Works

1.  **The Node Monitor Console** (`monitor/monitor_main.cpp`): The standalone `dmq-monitor` application that displays the topology table.
2.  **The Node Bridge** (`bridge/NodeBridge.cpp/.h`): A component you add to each application node. It subscribes to `dmq::databus::DataBus::Monitor` to auto-discover topics and message counts, then broadcasts a `dmq::NodeInfoPacket` heartbeat over UDP every second.

### Integrating NodeBridge into Your App

#### 1. Include the Bridge
Add `tools/bridge/NodeBridge.cpp`, `tools/bridge/NodeBridge.h`, and `tools/bridge/NodeInfoPacket.h` to your build system and enable `DMQ_DATABUS_TOOLS`.

#### 2. Start the Bridge
Call `Start` (unicast) or `StartMulticast` at application initialization, providing a unique node ID:

```cpp
#include "NodeBridge.h"

int main() {
    // Unicast heartbeats to the monitor console
    NodeBridge::Start("SensorNode-1", "127.0.0.1", 9998);

    // ... your app logic ...
    NodeBridge::Stop();
}
```

Topic and message count tracking is automatic — NodeBridge subscribes to `dmq::databus::DataBus::Monitor` internally and requires no per-topic registration.

### Usage

```bash
./dmq-monitor [port] [options]

# Basic unicast (default port 9998)
./dmq-monitor

# Join a multicast group (auto-detects local interface)
./dmq-monitor 9998 --multicast 239.1.1.1
```

**Controls:**
- `↑` / `↓` — Select a node to view its topics
- `c` — Clear all offline nodes from the table
- `q` — Quit

## Building

### Prerequisites
*   C++17 compatible compiler.
*   CMake 3.15+.
*   Dependencies (managed via the workspace `01_fetch_repos.py` script):
    *   [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI)
    *   [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)

### Build Instructions

Tools are built as part of the DelegateMQ repository by enabling the `DMQ_TOOLS` option:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DDMQ_TOOLS=ON ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

This produces three executables: `dmq-spy`, `dmq-monitor`, and `dmq-target` (a test application that exercises both bridges).
