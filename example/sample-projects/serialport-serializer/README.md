# Serial Port Transport Example

This project demonstrates how to use **DelegateMQ** to send structured data (serialized C++ objects) over a Serial Port (UART/RS-232).

It implements a reliable stream transport (`SerialTransport`) that:
1.  **Frames messages** using a length-prefixed protocol.
2.  **Serializes arguments** (like `std::list` and custom structs) into binary.
3.  **Invokes remote delegates** seamlessly across the serial link.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites: COM Ports

To run this demo, you need a pair of connected Serial Ports.

* **Sender** is configured to write to **`COM1`**.
* **Receiver** is configured to listen on **`COM2`**.

Ensure these ports exist and are connected (e.g., via a physical null-modem cable or a virtual port pair driver).

*(If you need to use different port names, edit the `Sender.h` and `Receiver.h` files before building.)*

## 🛠️ Step 1: Build Dependencies (libserialport)

This project depends on `libserialport`. Since this library does not natively support CMake, you must build it manually using Visual Studio.

Run `01_fetch_repos.py` to get the `libserialport` cloned to a workspace directory. 

### 1. Open the Solution
1.  Navigate to `../../../../libserialport`.
2.  Open **`libserialport.sln`** in Visual Studio.

### 2. Build the Library
1.  Set the Solution Configuration to **Debug**.
2.  Set the Platform to **x64**.
3.  Right-click the **libserialport** project and select **Build**.

The project uses `SERIALPORT_INCLUDE_DIR` and `SERIALPORT_LIBRARY_DIR` within `External.cmake` to locate the include and library files. Update if necessary. 

The `libserialport` also supports Linux and other platforms.

## 🚀 Step 2: Build and Run the Demo

### 1. Configure CMake
Open a terminal in this directory (`example/sample-projects/serialport-serializer`) and run:

```cmake -B build .```

### 2. Build and Run 
Build and run the application located within the `build` directory.
