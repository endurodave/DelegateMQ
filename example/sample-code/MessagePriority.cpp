/// @brief Demonstrate dmq::Priority::HIGH messages bypassing queued NORMAL work.
///
/// Each async delegate carries a priority tag (LOW / NORMAL / HIGH). The thread
/// message queue is a std::priority_queue, so when a HIGH message is enqueued
/// while NORMAL messages are already waiting, the HIGH message moves to the front
/// and is processed next — before any of the waiting NORMAL messages.
///
/// Priority only affects queued messages. A message already being executed cannot
/// be interrupted; the HIGH message runs as soon as the current handler returns.

    // MessagePriorityExample
    //
    // Five NORMAL tasks are queued back-to-back (each takes 30ms). While task 1
    // is executing, an EMERGENCY (HIGH priority) is posted. Because the thread
    // uses a priority queue, EMERGENCY is placed ahead of tasks 2-5 that are
    // still waiting, and runs immediately after task 1 finishes.
    //
    // Expected output:
    //   [NORMAL] task 1 started       <- already dequeued when EMERGENCY arrives
    //   [NORMAL] task 1 done
    //   [HIGH]   EMERGENCY handled    <- dequeued before tasks 2-5
    //   [NORMAL] task N started       <- tasks 2-5 run in heap order (not insertion order)
    //   ...
    //
    // Note: tasks 2-5 all have equal NORMAL priority; std::priority_queue gives no
    // stability guarantee among equal-priority items, so their order is unspecified.
